시나리오 1
user : I want to pay.

answer : It looks like you're in an office or study environment with various items on your desk, including papers, a fan, a cup, and a tissue box. If you need to pay for something, you can use the card that is partially visible on the desk. However, if you're referring to paying for services or products, it would be best to contact the relevant person or service provider directly. If you have any specific questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!

시나리오 2
user : My mouth smells weird.

answer : It's possible that the smell you're noticing is coming from the items on your desk, such as the perfume or other personal care products. Perfumes can sometimes have a strong scent that lingers on surfaces and in the air. If the smell is persistent, it might be worth cleaning your desk and checking for any lingering scents from the products you use.

If the smell is still there after cleaning, it could be coming from something else in your environment. It's important to note that strong odors can sometimes be unpleasant, but they don't necessarily indicate a health issue unless they are accompanied by other symptoms like a headache or dizziness.

If the smell is bothering you, try opening a window or using an air freshener to help clear the air. If the problem persists, it might be best to consult a professional to rule out any underlying issues.
